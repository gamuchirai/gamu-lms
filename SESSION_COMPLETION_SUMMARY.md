  - Type-based icon color coding (blue/green/orange/red)
  - Empty state messaging
  - Loading spinner animation

- ‚úÖ Complete JavaScript functionality
  - `toggleNotifications()` - Show/hide dropdown, auto-close on outside click
  - `loadNotifications()` - Fetch from API, populate dropdown, handle empty state
  - `markAsRead(notificationId)` - Individual mark as read with UI update

  - `escapeHtml()` - XSS protection for user content
  - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds for new notifications

**Backend API Endpoints:**
- ‚úÖ `/public/api/notifications/list.php`
  - Returns all user notifications (limit 50, newest first)
  - Includes id, title, message, type, read status, created_at
  - Requires authentication (session check)

- ‚úÖ `/public/api/notifications/mark_read.php`
  - Marks single notification as read
  - Verifies notification belongs to current user (security)
  - POST method, accepts notification_id parameter

- ‚úÖ `/public/api/notifications/mark_all_read.php`
  - Marks all unread notifications as read for user
  - Returns count of updated notifications
  - POST method, no parameters needed

- ‚úÖ `/public/api/notifications/unread_count.php`
  - Returns current unread notification count
  - Used for badge updates and polling
  - GET method, no parameters

**Integration:**
- ‚úÖ Dynamic unread count query in topbar
- ‚úÖ Badge display only when count > 0
- ‚úÖ Dropdown HTML structure with proper IDs
- ‚úÖ Event listeners for outside click to close
- ‚úÖ Profile dropdown closes when notifications open (mutual exclusion)

**Testing Utility:**

### 2. Role-Based Navigation Security ‚úÖ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Removed cross-role navigation links from `/public/sidebar.php`
  - Admin section cleaned (removed student badge/events links)
  - Added comment: "Student role should not see this sidebar"
  - Settings link now role-aware

- ‚úÖ Verified role guards on all pages
  - Ran grep search: Found 20+ matches for `$allowed_roles`
  - All student pages have proper role guard arrays
  - Most allow ['student', 'instructor', 'admin']
  - Dashboard restricted to ['student'] only

- ‚úÖ Separate navigation systems implemented
  - Students: Top navigation bar (student_topbar.php)
  - Admin/Instructors: Sidebar navigation (sidebar.php)
  - Clear separation prevents cross-role access

### 3. Student Layout Migration (COMPLETE) ‚úÖ‚úÖ

**Layout Logic:**
```php
$user_role = $_SESSION['role_name'] ?? '';
$use_student_layout = ($user_role === 'student');

if ($use_student_layout) {
    require_once __DIR__ . '/../../includes/student_topbar.php';
} else {
    require_once __DIR__ . '/../../includes/header.php';
}
```

## üí° Key Implementation Decisions

### Why Separate Navigation Systems?
- **Better UX:** Students get cleaner, modern interface
- **Role Clarity:** Clear visual distinction between roles
- **Maintainability:** Easier to update per-role features
- **Performance:** Lighter DOM for student pages

### Why Client-Side Notification Rendering?
- **Flexibility:** Easy to add filters, search, pagination
- **Responsiveness:** Instant UI updates on actions
- **Scalability:** Can add real-time updates later (WebSockets)
- **Security:** API validates all operations server-side

### Why 30-Second Auto-Refresh?
- **Balance:** Frequent enough for near-real-time feel
- **Performance:** Not too aggressive on server load
- **UX:** Users see new notifications without manual refresh
- **Battery:** Doesn't drain mobile devices

### Why SQL `read` Field Instead of `is_unread`?
- **Clarity:** `read = 1` means read, `read = 0` means unread
- **Database Convention:** Common pattern in notifications
- **Query Simplicity:** `WHERE read = 0` is intuitive
- **Index Performance:** Binary field indexes well

---

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations:
1. **No Real-Time Updates:** Uses polling (30s) instead of WebSockets
   - **Impact:** Notifications appear with up to 30s delay
   - **Solution:** Acceptable for MVP, can upgrade to WebSockets later

2. **No Notification Filtering:** Shows all notifications
   - **Impact:** Long list if many notifications
   - **Solution:** Added 50-item limit, can add pagination later

3. **No Notification Deletion:** Only mark as read
   - **Impact:** Notification list can grow large
   - **Solution:** Can add delete functionality or auto-archive after 30 days

4. **No Push Notifications:** Only in-app notifications
   - **Impact:** Users must be logged in to see notifications
   - **Solution:** Can add email notifications or browser push later

### Edge Cases Handled:
- ‚úÖ Empty notification list (shows friendly message)
- ‚úÖ API errors (shows error message, logs to console)
- ‚úÖ Concurrent mark-as-read calls (database handles with transactions)
- ‚úÖ XSS attacks (escapeHtml function protects)
- ‚úÖ Unauthorized access (session checks on all APIs)
- ‚úÖ Mobile viewport (responsive design)

```

---

## üîê Security Audit

### Authentication ‚úÖ
- All API endpoints check `$_SESSION['user_id']`
- Reject unauthenticated requests immediately
- No token-based auth needed (session cookies sufficient)

### Authorization ‚úÖ
- Notification APIs verify ownership via `WHERE user_id = ?`
- Users cannot access other users' notifications
- Role guards prevent cross-role page access

### Input Validation ‚úÖ
- `notification_id` cast to integer
- SQL injection prevented with prepared statements
- No direct user input in queries

### Output Encoding ‚úÖ
- `escapeHtml()` function for user content
- Prevents XSS in notification title/message
- Type checking on notification type

### CSRF Protection ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Current:** Relies on SameSite cookie attribute
- **Recommendation:** Add CSRF tokens to POST requests (future enhancement)

### Rate Limiting ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Current:** No rate limiting on API endpoints
- **Recommendation:** Add rate limiting to prevent abuse (e.g., 100 req/min per user)

### SQL Injection ‚úÖ
- All queries use prepared statements
- No string concatenation in SQL
- Parameter binding for all user inputs

### File Upload Security ‚úÖ
- (Already handled in previous session)
- File type validation
- File size limits
- Unique filename generation
