## 📋 Database Changes

### Step 1: Run the Update SQL
You need to run `update_student_tasks.sql` to:
1. Add `completed` column (tracks if task is done)
2. Modify `task_type` enum to include 'lesson'
3. Insert sample lesson tasks
4. Mark some tasks as completed for testing

**Run this command:**
```bash
# Via MySQL command line:
mysql -u root -p u376937047_gamuchirai_db < update_student_tasks.sql

# Or import via phpMyAdmin
```

## 💡 How It Works

### Frontend (JavaScript):
1. User clicks checkbox on a task
2. AJAX request sent to `update_task.php`
3. Response received with success/failure
4. If successful:
   - Stat cards update with new counts
   - Task fades out and removes from list
   - If no tasks remain, shows "No upcoming tasks"

### Backend (PHP):
1. `update_task.php` receives task_id and completed status
2. Validates user is logged in
3. Updates task in database (only for logged-in student)
4. Queries updated stats for all task types
5. Returns JSON with success flag and new stats

### Database:
- `student_tasks.completed` = 0 (not done) or 1 (done)
- Dashboard only shows tasks where `completed = 0`
- Stats count all tasks vs completed tasks per type

---

## 📊 Sample Data Included

After running the SQL update, you'll have:
- **6 Lesson tasks** (1 completed)
- **4 Assignment tasks** (1 completed)
- **2 Test tasks** (1 completed)

All with various due dates for testing!

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Task priority levels (high, medium, low)
- Task descriptions/details modal
- Filter tasks by type
- Date picker to reschedule tasks
- Admin interface to manage all student tasks
- Email reminders for due tasks
- Task history/archive view
- Progress tracking with percentages

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Stats showing 0/0?
- Make sure you ran `update_student_tasks.sql`
- Check that tasks exist for the logged-in student

### Checkbox doesn't work?
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify `update_task.php` exists in `public/` folder
- Check database connection in `config/db_config.php`

### Tasks not disappearing?
- Clear browser cache
- Refresh the page
- Check that JavaScript is enabled
