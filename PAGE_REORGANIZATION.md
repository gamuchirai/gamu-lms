## Updates Applied

### 1. Role Guard Implementation
All moved pages now use the new `role_guard.php` system:
```php
<?php 
$allowed_roles = ['admin']; // or ['instructor', 'admin'] or ['student', 'instructor', 'admin']
require_once __DIR__ . '/../../includes/role_guard.php';
require_once __DIR__ . '/../../includes/header.php';
require_once __DIR__ . '/../../config/db_config.php';
?>
```

### 2. Navigation Updates
- `public/sidebar.php` - Updated all navigation links to use new `/views/` paths
- Links now point to:
  - `/views/admin/dashboard.php`
  - `/views/instructor/dashboard.php`
  - `/views/student/dashboard.php`
  - etc.

### 3. Redirect Updates
- `public/login.php` - Updated role-based redirects
- `public/verify_email.php` - Updated email verification redirects
- `includes/role_guard.php` - Updated unauthorized access redirects

### 4. API Path Updates
All fetch() calls updated to use absolute paths from new locations:
- `/public/api/courses/add.php`
- `/public/api/lessons/list.php`
- `/public/api/assignments/add.php`
- `/public/api/enrollment/enroll.php`
- etc.

### 5. Internal Link Updates
- Instructor dashboard links to `course.php` instead of `instructor_course.php`
- All cross-page references updated for new structure

## Public Folder Contents

The `public/` folder now contains only:
- **Authentication pages**: `login.php`, `register.php`, `logout.php`, `verify_email.php`, `resend_verification.php`
- **Shared components**: `sidebar.php`, `topbar.php`, `update_task.php`
- **Legacy/static files**: `login.html`, `index.html`, `dashboard-template.html`
- **API folder**: Organized into subfolders
- **Assets folder**: Images and uploads

## Testing Checklist

### Admin Role
- [ ] Login redirects to `/views/admin/dashboard.php`
- [ ] Sidebar links work correctly
- [ ] Manage Users page loads and functions
- [ ] Manage Courses page loads and API calls work
- [ ] Activity logs accessible

### Instructor Role
- [ ] Login redirects to `/views/instructor/dashboard.php`
- [ ] Course list displays correctly
- [ ] "Manage" links go to `/views/instructor/course.php`
- [ ] Lesson CRUD operations work
- [ ] Assignment CRUD operations work

### Student Role
- [ ] Login redirects to `/views/student/dashboard.php`
- [ ] Courses page displays enrolled and available courses
- [ ] Enroll/unenroll functionality works
- [ ] View course page shows lessons, assignments, and (for instructors) students
- [ ] View lesson page displays content correctly
- [ ] View assignment page allows file upload

## Known Issues / Next Steps

1. **CSS Paths**: Header.php uses relative paths (`../assets/css/dashboard.css`). This works from views subfolders. If you encounter styling issues, may need to update to absolute paths.

2. **Legacy Files**: `course_view_old.php` exists - can be deleted once `view_course.php` is confirmed working.

3. **Missing Footers**: Some moved pages may need footer includes added.

4. **Assignment Submission API**: The submission endpoint `/public/api/assignments/submit.php` needs to be created for the upload functionality to work.

5. **Progress Tracking**: "Mark as Complete" button in lesson view is a placeholder - needs implementation.
